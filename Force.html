<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
    Definition: The Force Matrix is the amount of force used upon a suspect who is under the process of being arrested or detained.
</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
    These will now be enforced on an Administrative level. Faction members are required to follow the Force Matrix unless in the case it is heavily roleplayed and is not to the extreme. Use of pepper spray/nitestick is permitted if not used in a way of excessive force. It will be considered Non-Roleplay Behavior to not follow these; for example, to shoot upon an individual who by the Force Matrix would not be considered to have committed a crime that warrants such force.
